## 👋Hello, I'm IntelScripter


I started coding a few years ago and have been coding numerous projects since. I started out coding roblox games in Lua which is when I got into automation and started learning python. I hope to learn many more languages and create many more projects in the future. I’m currently developing more python projects and learning ethical hacking.
